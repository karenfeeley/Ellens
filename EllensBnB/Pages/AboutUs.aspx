			<h5>Duncan - London</h5>
			<p>
				<em>A very nice B&amp;B, really a guesthouse as the name implies, that sits right in the heart of Galway. Everything was a short 5-10 walk away.  
					The room was nicely comfortable with a spacious en suite bathroom. <br>Breakfast was excellent and ample.  
					Ellen is a very pleasant and energetic woman that made our stay memorable.  Thanks to Ellen for her assistance in
					identifying places to eat, drink, and listen to music! We highly recommend Ellen’s B&amp;B Guesthouse</em>

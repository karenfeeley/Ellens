			From Apr - Sep the castle comes alive with medieval banquets &amp; performances. Part of the lore is that the Lord of the castle 
			was very generous and he continued this generosity into the afterlife. Today, if a person stands at the front gate and asks a question, 
			they will have an answer to their question by the end of the day.
